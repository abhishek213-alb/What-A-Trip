# What-A-Trip

## Inspiration
There are many people who like games and play Super Mario. It is childhood game of many people. A lot of them dream of traveling or being able to interact with Super Mario characters. That dream is no longer far since we have SUPER NINTENDO WORLD in Japan. 

With that, we hope to build a site that offers people traveling trip, road side assistance,  and our special traveling package offer to Super Nintendo World in Japan. Are you a gamer ? Have you played Super Mario when you were small? Do you have a dream to travel to the real Super Mario World to fulfill your childhood dream? Then you should definitely visit our site "What a Trip". 

## What it does

## How we built it
- The map was built by taking Google Map API which turned the real life map to Super Mario World map. For the map, we also use Google Map console, map JavaScript API, HTML, and CSS to build the map. 
- The game was built in Python
- Replit
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Google Cloud
- Twilio
- Whatsapp
-Coil
- Google Map console
- Github
- Linode
- Python
- GPS Tracking

## Backend
We use Linode and Google Cloud for back end. 


## Challenges we ran into
We faced many challenges integrating everything and working in different time zones. We also had to setup Twilio, Chat-bots, a website front-end, a website back-end with Linode, and in particular, we had to set up maps & working with coil for the first time. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Mario has always been a favorite game for many people when they were children and now we are making something that fulfills a dream as well as keeping our users safe on the roads with our trvavel assistant 

## What we learned
It was exciting to learn more about coil this week and how they reward the content creators, publishers and platforms that create the content that we love. The best part is that we don't have to rely on advertising or site-by-site subscriptions.

In addition, we learned how to use Google Maps Console  and the GPS navigation system, which we used in our map

## What's next for What-A-Trip
We plan to make the map interactive and allow users to interact more with the map.
